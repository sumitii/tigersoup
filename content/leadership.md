1. ### Overcapacity + Compressed Demand
Growth will require keeping your own customers while stealing those from competitors. Requirements: Renewed focus on keeping every single customer; improving customer experiences; getting more strategic and competitive marketing campaigns; improve customer service.

2. ### Counteracting competitive aggression
Expect leading competitors to upgrade their advertising campaigns in all media. Requirements: Build stronger intelligence on competitors; improve speed to market; talk to your own customers and invest in differentiating your brand.

3. ### Commodity Perception
The less differentiated your company is, the stronger the need will be to reduce prices to get business. Certain industries (like banking) have brand differentiation with almost no meaning to customers. Digital interfaces between competitors offer almost the same experiences. Requirements: Investigation among your most important customer groups about their experience with your brand, revamping websites, apps, and other consumer interfaces to add personality, energy and enthusiasm to their experiences.

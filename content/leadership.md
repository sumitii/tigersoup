leadership_quote_p1: "In 2019 a Forrester research study concluded that in the age of martech and digital automation, brands across categories are becoming indistinguishable from each other. In our post-COVID-19 age, many companies will have to re-evaluate how they not only keep their own customers from the grips of strong competitors, but how they can steal customers from formidable competitors. In markets where demand is diminished inventiveness emerges. We are now entering an age of fierce competition."
leadership_quote_p2: "I have spent a long career working in leadership roles alongside a host of inventive minds, many of whom have created work that is recognizable across the planet. Bringing together powerful creative minds into a focus that helps companies differentiate from their competitors requires careful curation of competitive minds. That is what we have set out to do with Tiger Soup."

1. ### Overcapacity + Compressed Demand
Growth will require keeping your own customers while stealing those from competitors. Requirements: Renewed focus on keeping every single customer; improving customer experiences; getting more strategic and competitive marketing campaigns; improve customer service.

2. ### Counteracting competitive aggression
Expect leading competitors to upgrade their advertising campaigns in all media. Requirements: Build stronger intelligence on competitors; improve speed to market; talk to your own customers and invest in differentiating your brand.

3. ### Commodity Perception
The less differentiated your company is, the stronger the need will be to reduce prices to get business. Certain industries (like banking) have brand differentiation with almost no meaning to customers. Digital interfaces between competitors offer almost the same experiences. Requirements: Investigation among your most important customer groups about their experience with your brand, revamping websites, apps, and other consumer interfaces to add personality, energy and enthusiasm to their experiences.

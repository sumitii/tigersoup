With the corona virus business shutdown, the world as we knew it is forever changed. It will be many years before we fully recover from the mess that is only now beginning to show itself. With shrunken markets in our future and fierce pressure for growth, companies will have to grab share from their competitors to meet their goals. Per Forrester Research this is not what today’s digital design industry is offering major brands. 

The focus on efficiency and cost as the most important elements in choice of creative talent must now give way to looking for creative organizations that know how to go into the marketplace picking a fight. Hiring creative people with the skills to drive market share through strategic, powerful, courageous, and well produced campaigns – whatever the cost - will be the new norm. 

At least for the companies that are dedicated to coming out on top Why do I predict this? Because victory in the marketplace will now be hard won. Period. And superior talent – and minds – win. Period. Those who demonstrate that they can capture the imagination of worldwide audiences will be in high demand.

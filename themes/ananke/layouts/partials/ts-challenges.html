          <h3>Commodity Perception</h3>
          <p class="copy-par">The less differentiated your company is, the stronger the need will be to reduce prices to get business. Certain industries (like banking) have brand differentiation with almost no meaning to customers. Digital interfaces between competitors offer almost the same experiences. Requirements: Investigation among your most important customer groups about their experience with your brand, revamping websites, apps, and other consumer interfaces to add personality, energy and enthusiasm to their experiences.</p>

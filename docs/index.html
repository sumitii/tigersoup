    <p>If you want tiger soup, you have to catch a tiger. When making tiger soup it is best to first focus on catching a tiger. It is a common mistake to spend too much time searching for fresh vegetables and unique spices. These are easy and fun to do. While these activities are certainly essential in making a savory soup, the hard part is getting your hands on a tiger. No tiger&hellip;NO tiger soup!</p>
<p>When change comes to an industry it is normal for marketing people to continue doing what they are used to doing. That’s easier and it’s human nature.</p>
<p>When the rules change, as they just have, it is imperative to look straight at the depth of the problem and to recognize that new ways of thinking may be required to restart the engines of commerce. That is catching the tiger.</p>

  <h3 class="measure f3 grey-900 fw4">Tiger Soup custom assembles remote teams of creative leaders around the world to swiftly solve unique marketing challenges that current resources cannot solve either through lack of available time or lack of experience.</h3>
  <div class="measure-wide f4 lh-copy chronicle grey-900 js-content">
    <p>The new reality facing companies is that markets have shrunk and winning now requires taking a new kind of fight to the marketplace. Like catching  a tiger, this can be a tough undertaking. One that takes special skills and deep understanding of  the dynamics of industry segments. Stealing customers from competitors as they grow ever-more aggressive in attempting to do the same thing to you will be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Marketplace success now depends on the ability to move quickly, outthink your competition and steal the show through powerful work that pulses throughout the marketplace. Plus creating new customer relationships earned through effective strategy, smart decisions and brilliant execution. Out-thinking competitors every step of the way will be the new dynamic.</p>
<p>TigerSoup works with top leadership of brands that are concerned their built-in resources aren’t pivoting to the new realities fast enough.  Or that their existing teams don’t have the training to quick-start the response to the new realities. We custom assemble teams of talented people with deep knowledge of the industry in question along with life-long records of superior performance in the marketplace. Ours is a completely virtual business with no offices, work is conducted via video screen and online communications. Which means we can choose team members from a worldwide pool of the best possible talent.</p>
<p>Our job is not to replace valued creative resources. Rather, we help companies quickly pivot to the new marketplace by redefining communication strategies, evaluating consumer experiences in comparison to competitors, and creating bold new work that demonstrates industry leadership. Once we have caught the tiger we disappear with no expectations of ongoing work.</p>

<h3 id="counteracting-competitive-aggression">Counteracting competitive aggression</h3>

<p>The less differentiated your company is, the stronger the need will be to reduce prices to get business. Certain industries (like banking) have brand differentiation with almost no meaning to customers. Digital interfaces between competitors offer almost the same experiences. Requirements: Investigation among your most important customer groups about their experience with your brand, revamping websites, apps, and other consumer interfaces to add personality, energy and enthusiasm to their experiences.</p>

      <p>Long ago, there was a King and his favorite chef. The king’s favorite chef had a
knack for making tasty soups. Much of his success lay with the gathering of unique local vegetables and spices and roasting these into a savory base. Into this carefully produced stock he added a variety of meats like fish, chicken and whatever else he
could catch. The soup was so tasty that it didn’t matter much what meat was added.
The king loved the soups and the chef lived a happy and stress-free life.</p>
<p>One day the king got an unusual dinner request from an important visitor from a far-
off land. The chef was thus ordered to make tiger soup for dinner several days hence.</p>
<p>Thinking catching a tiger would happen by setting bigger traps, the chef requested
extra money from the king. He then set out to the forest to find the ingredients for this special dinner. He knew just what he wanted to gather and spent much of his time
finding the vegetables, peeling onions, combining spices and moderating the heat to
build the base for his tiger soup. After all, this had always been his secret of success.</p>
<p>Tigers were known in those days for their intelligence, beauty and cunning. They laughed at the traps.</p>
<p>As the days passed Hedgehog put out more traps, confident a tiger would be caught. “If I just make more of the soup base, perhaps the wind will carry the lovely smell to a tiger and she will simply jump into my pot.”</p>
<p>In the end there was no tiger soup and the king’s embarrassment was so great the he banished Hedgehog from the land.</p>

    <div class="measure f4 lh-copy ml0">
      <p class="copy-par">It is a common mistake to spend too much time searching for fresh vegetables and unique spices. These are easy and fun to do. While these activities are certainly essential in making a savory soup, the hard part is getting your hands on a tiger. No tiger...NO tiger soup!</p>
      <p class="copy-par">When change comes to an industry it is normal for marketing people to continue doing what they are used to doing. That’s easier and it’s human nature.</p>        
      <p class="copy-par">When the rules change, as they just have, it is imperative to look straight at the depth of the problem and to recognize that new ways of thinking may be required to restart the engines of commerce. That is catching the tiger.</p>

    <h3 class="mb4 w-100">Long ago, there was a King and his favorite chef.</h3>
    <div class="who-we-are__copy measure f4 lh-copy ml0">
      <p class="copy-par">The king’s favorite chef had a knack for making tasty soups. Much of his success lay with the gathering of unique local vegetables and spices and roasting these into a savory base. Into this carefully produced stock he added a variety of meats like fish, chicken and whatever else he could catch. The soup was so tasty that it didn’t matter much what meat was added. The king loved the soups and the chef lived a happy and stress-free life.</p>
      <p class="copy-par">One day the king got an unusual dinner request from an important visitor from a far-off land. The chef was thus ordered to make tiger soup for dinner several days hence.</p>
      <p class="copy-par">Thinking catching a tiger would happen by setting bigger traps, the chef requested extra money from the king. He then set out to the forest to find the ingredients for this special dinner. He knew just what he wanted to gather and spent much of his time finding the vegetables, peeling onions, combining spices and moderating the heat to build the base for his tiger soup.</p>
      <p class="copy-par">After all, this had always been his secret of success.
        Tigers were known in those days for their intelligence, beauty and cunning. They laughed at the traps.
        As the days passed Hedgehog put out more traps, confident a tiger would be caught. “If I just make more of the soup base, perhaps the wind will carry the lovely smell to a tiger and she will simply jump into my pot.” 
        In the end there was no tiger soup and the king’s embarrassment was so great the he banished Hedgehog from the land. 
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote-text">The Moral: When unusual challenges arise, it is natural to focus on the things that have worked for us in the past. When making tiger soup however, it is best to focus first on catching the tiger. This often requires thinking untethered by the past.</blockquote>

Certain industries (like banking) have brand differentiation with almost no meaning to customers. Digital interfaces between competitors offer almost the same experiences. Requirements: Investigation among your most important customer groups about their experience with your brand, revamping websites, apps, and other consumer interfaces to add personality, energy and enthusiasm to their experiences.</p>

        <div><p>With the corona virus business shutdown, the world as we knew it is forever changed. It will be many years before we fully recover from the mess that is only now beginning to show itself. With shrunken markets in our future and fierce pressure for growth, companies will have to grab share from their competitors to meet their goals. Per Forrester Research this is not what today’s digital design industry is offering major brands.</p>
<p>The focus on efficiency and cost as the most important elements in choice of creative talent must now give way to looking for creative organizations that know how to go into the marketplace picking a fight. Hiring creative people with the skills to drive market share through strategic, powerful, courageous, and well produced campaigns – whatever the cost - will be the new norm.</p>
<p>At least for the companies that are dedicated to coming out on top Why do I predict this? Because victory in the marketplace will now be hard won. Period. And superior talent – and minds – win. Period. Those who demonstrate that they can capture the imagination of worldwide audiences will be in high demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line:  in 2019 consumers could not tell the difference between one brand to another in the digital age. In the post-Covid19 age, this can spell disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the worldwide meeting in 2019 for the Society of Digital Agencies, Keith Johnston of Forrester sent a strong message to digital agencies who create consumer “experiences” in his talk “Humans, Machines, and Creativity”. The bottom line:  in 2019 consumers could not tell the difference between one brand to another in the digital age. In the post-Covid19 age, this can spell disaster.</p>

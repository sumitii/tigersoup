      <description>With the corona virus business shutdown, the world as we knew it is forever changed. It will be many years before we fully recover from the mess that is only now beginning to show itself. With shrunken markets in our future and fierce pressure for growth, companies will have to grab share from their competitors to meet their goals. Per Forrester Research this is not what today’s digital design industry is offering major brands.</description>

While these activities are certainly essential in making a savory soup, the hard part is getting your hands on a tiger. No tiger&amp;hellip;NO tiger soup!</description>

      <description>Long ago, there was a King and his favorite chef. The king’s favorite chef had a knack for making tasty soups. Much of his success lay with the gathering of unique local vegetables and spices and roasting these into a savory base. Into this carefully produced stock he added a variety of meats like fish, chicken and whatever else he could catch. The soup was so tasty that it didn’t matter much what meat was added.</description>

      <description>The new reality facing companies is that markets have shrunk and winning now requires taking a new kind of fight to the marketplace. Like catching a tiger, this can be a tough undertaking. One that takes special skills and deep understanding of the dynamics of industry segments. Stealing customers from competitors as they grow ever-more aggressive in attempting to do the same thing to you will be the name of the game.</description>

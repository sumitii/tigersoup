        <p>The new reality facing companies is that markets have shrunk and winning now requires taking a new kind of fight to the marketplace. Like catching  a tiger, this can be a tough undertaking. One that takes special skills and deep understanding of  the dynamics of industry segments. Stealing customers from competitors as they grow ever-more aggressive in attempting to do the same thing to you will be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Marketplace success now depends on the ability to move quickly, outthink your competition and steal the show through powerful work that pulses throughout the marketplace. Plus creating new customer relationships earned through effective strategy, smart decisions and brilliant execution. Out-thinking competitors every step of the way will be the new dynamic.</p>
<p>TigerSoup works with top leadership of brands that are concerned their built-in resources aren’t pivoting to the new realities fast enough.  Or that their existing teams don’t have the training to quick-start the response to the new realities. We custom assemble teams of talented people with deep knowledge of the industry in question along with life-long records of superior performance in the marketplace. Ours is a completely virtual business with no offices, work is conducted via video screen and online communications. Which means we can choose team members from a worldwide pool of the best possible talent.</p>
<p>Our job is not to replace valued creative resources. Rather, we help companies quickly pivot to the new marketplace by redefining communication strategies, evaluating consumer experiences in comparison to competitors, and creating bold new work that demonstrates industry leadership. Once we help your team catch the tiger we disappear with no expectation of ongoing work.</p>

  <div class="mb4 mb3-ns leadership__quote f4 lh-copy chronicle grey-900">
    <p>"In 2019 a Forrester research study concluded that in the age of martech and digital automation, brands across categories are becoming indistinguishable from each other. In our post-COVID-19 age, many companies will have to re-evaluate how they not only keep their own customers from the grips of strong competitors, but how they can steal customers from formidable competitors. In markets where demand is diminished inventiveness emerges. We are now entering an age of fierce competition.</p>
    <p>I have spent a long career working in leadership roles alongside a host of inventive minds, many of whom have created work that is recognizable across the planet. Bringing together powerful creative minds into a focus that helps companies differentiate from their competitors requires careful curation of competitive minds. That is what we have set out to do with Tiger Soup."</p>
